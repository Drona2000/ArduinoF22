# ArduinoF22 IoT for Optimal Sleeping Environment
The purpose of this project is to create a device/program which measures the
room environment and gives feedback based on the observations.
Experts recommend a specific environment in a room for a individual to get opti-
mal sleep, and this program will be able to give feedback to the user.
This program will measure the room temperature, humidity, brightness and noise
and will make a RGB light up in either green, yellow or red based on the sleeping
environment.
The project will use an ESP to upload the observations to ThingSpeak.
